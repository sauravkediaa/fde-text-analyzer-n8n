# fde-text-analyzer
This repo will be the starting point of my n8n workflow in which my frontend will send a request to my n8n trigger node with text and mode (summary/sentiment analysis). n8n node will then communicate with Gemini's LLM and send back a response which will be pushed to the frontend.
